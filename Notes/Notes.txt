2D-3D pose rectification 
Called PnP problem (Perspective n Points)

Given:
P_i in R^3, i = 1, ..., N in world
p_i in R^2, i = 1, ..., N in image
Find:
R in SO(3), T in R^3 s.t.
lambda_i*p_i = R*P_1 + T
In other words, where is the camera?

Another problem:
You are in a ship on a cloudy night. You see a light house,
and you know where is the map. 
(A) We have a compass - we can find our bearing from this.
    But we can't find our exact distance so we know where we
    are on a line
(B) We see two light house. We (by elementary geometry) can
    only constrain ourselves to a circle. 
(C) We see three light houses. Then we can know our position
    exactly

So for the 3D case, how many points do we need? Tricky
           [ x_i ]       [ X_i ]
lambda_i * [ y_i ] = R * [ Y_i ] + T
           [  1  ]       [ Z_i ] 
   ^- Unknown        ^- Unknown    ^- Unknown
3 Unknowns for R, 3 Unknowns for T. Can eliminate the 
lambda_i's: hi there
(r_32*X_i + r_32*Y_i + r_33*Z_i + T_3)*x_i = r_11*X_i + r_12*Y_i + r_13*Z_i + T_1
(r_32*X_i + r_32*Y_i + r_33*Z_i + T_3)*y_i = r_21*X_i + r_22*Y_i + r_23*Z_i + T_3

Edge Features
Def: Edge = Sharp changes in the image
d/dt (I(x) * g(x)) = I(x) * dg(x)/dt
Steerability - Gradient along angle theta I(x) = cos(theta) (I(x) * dg_x(x)/dt) + sin(theta) (I(x) * dg_y(x)/dt)

Point Features
Ideas: Autocorrelation matrix:
sum_{x in N(x_0)} [ (I_x)^2, I_x I_y ]
                  [ I_x I_y, (I_y)^2 ] 
Eigenvalues of this determine how 'good' the corner is

Optical Flow
Solve:
( sum_{x in N(x_0)} [ (I_x)^2, I_x I_y ] )^{-1} ( sum_{x in N(x_0)} Delta I(x) [ I_x ] )
(                   [ I_x I_y, (I_y)^2 ] )      (                              [ I_y ] )
